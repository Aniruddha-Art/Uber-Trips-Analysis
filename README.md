# Uber-Trips-Analysis
Analyzing Uber trips allows us to identify patterns such as the day with the highest and lowest trips, the busiest hour for Uber, and many other trends. The dataset used in this analysis is based on Uber trips from New York City, which has a complex transportation system and a large residential community.
The dataset contains information on approximately 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September, as well as 14.3 million pickups from January to June 2015.

This project analyzes Uber trips data to uncover insights and patterns. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization of key metrics to understand the trends in Uber trips.
